    "**What is an Outlier?** \n",
    "Outlier is an row/observation that appears far away and diverges from an overall pattern in a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the types of Outliers?**\n",
    "1. Univariate: These outliers can be found when we look at distribution of a single variable\n",
    "2. Multivariate: are outliers in an n-dimensional space. In order to find them, you have to look at distributions in multi-dimensions. example (hight=100, weight=100) for a person\n",
    "\n",
    "**What causes Outliers?**\n",
    "Whenever we come across outliers, the ideal way to tackle them is to find out the reason of having these outliers. The method to deal with them would then depend on the reason of their occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s understand various types of outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Entry Errors:- Human errors such as errors caused during data collection, recording, or entry can cause outliers in data.\n",
    "2. Measurement Error: It is the most common source of outliers. This is caused when the measurement instrument used turns out to be faulty.\n",
    "3. Data Processing Error: Whenever we perform data mining, we extract data from multiple sources. It is possible that some manipulation or extraction errors may lead to outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "4. Sampling error: For instance, we have to measure the height of athletes. By mistake, we include a few basketball players in the sample. This inclusion is likely to cause outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "5. Natural Outlier: When an outlier is not artificial (due to error), it is a natural outlier. For instance: In my last assignment with one of the renowned insurance company, I noticed that the performance of top 50 financial advisors was far higher than rest of the population. Surprisingly, it was not due to any error. Hence, whenever we perform any data mining activity with advisors, we used to treat this segment separately.\n",

    "**How to detect Outliers?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Most commonly used method to detect outliers is visualization (Univariate Graphical Analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "We use 3 common visualization methods:\n",
    ">- Box-plot: A box plot is a method for graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles. The box extends from the Q1 to Q3 quartile values of the data, with a line at the median (Q2). The whiskers extend from the edges of the box to show the range of the data. Outlier points are those past the end of the whiskers. Box plots show robust measures of location and spread as well as providing information about symmetry and outliers.\n",

    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- Histogram\n",
    ">- Scatter Plot: A scatter plot is a mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for two variables for a set of data. The data are displayed as a collection of points, each having the value of one variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and the value of the other variable determining the position on the vertical axis. The points that are far from the population can be termed as an outlier.\n",

    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using statistical method (Univariate Non-Graphical analysis):\n",
    ">- Any value, which is beyond the range of -1.5 x IQR to 1.5 x IQR\n",
    " \n",
    "![image.png](https://www.whatissixsigma.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Box-Plot-Diagram-to-identify-Outliers-figure-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    ">- Use capping methods. Any value which out of range of 5th and 95th percentile can be considered as outlier\n",
    ">- Data points, three or more standard deviation away from mean are considered outlier: The Z-score is the signed number of standard deviations by which the value of an observation or data point is above the mean value of what is being observed or measured. While calculating the Z-score we re-scale and center the data and look for data points that are too far from zero. These data points which are way too far from zero will be treated as the outliers. In most of the cases, a threshold of 3 or -3 is used i.e if the Z-score value is greater than or less than 3 or -3 respectively, that data point will be identified as outliers.\n",
    "> - Outlier detection is merely a special case of the examination of data for influential data points and it also depends on the business understanding\n"

First data set become training data set of the model while second data set with missing values is test data set and variable with missing values is treated as target variable. Next, we create a model to predict target variable based on other attributes of the training data set and populate missing values of test data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "> There are 2 drawbacks for this approach:\n",
    "> - The model estimated values are usually more well-behaved than the true values\n",
    "> - If there are no relationships with attributes in the data set and the attribute with missing values, then the model will not be precise for estimating missing values.\n",

    "9. KNN Imputation: In this method of imputation, the missing values of an attribute are imputed using the given number of attributes that are most similar to the attribute whose values are missing. The similarity of two attributes is determined using a distance function. It is also known to have certain advantage & disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "   > **Advantages:**\n",
    "   > - k-nearest neighbour can predict both qualitative & quantitative attributes\n",
    "   > - Creation of predictive model for each attribute with missing data is not required\n",
    "   > - Attributes with multiple missing values can be easily treated\n",
    "   > - Correlation structure of the data is taken into consideration\n",
    "\n",
    "   > **Disadvantage:**\n",
    "   > - KNN algorithm is very time-consuming in analyzing large database. It searches through all the dataset looking for the most similar instances.\n",
    "   > - Choice of k-value is very critical. Higher value of k would include attributes which are significantly different from what we need whereas lower value of k implies missing out of significant attributes.\n",

    "Most of the ways to deal with outliers are similar to the methods of missing values like deleting rows, transforming them, binning them, treat them as a separate group, imputing values and other statistical methods. Here, we will discuss the common techniques used to deal with outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deleting rows: We delete outlier values if it is due to data entry error, data processing error or outlier rows are very small in numbers. We can also use trimming at both ends to remove outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Imputing: Like imputation of missing values, we can also impute outliers. We can use mean, median, mode imputation methods. Before imputing values, we should analyse if it is natural outlier or artificial. If it is artificial, we can go with imputing values. We can also use statistical model to predict values of outlier rows and after that we can impute it with predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Treat separately: If there are significant number of outliers, we should treat them separately in the statistical model. One of the approach is to treat both groups as two different groups and build individual model for both groups and then combine the output.\n"
